# ReproducibilityRaptors
ReproducibilityRaptors Project Team for STAT 5014 Fall 2020 (Danielle Sebring, Ankur Patel, Andy Cooper)
The main goal of our project will be to create a real-time dashboard of COVIDcase data using RShiny. We will create an interactive time series figure with the ability for user to filter through features including but not limited to patient race, patient age, and patient location across Virginia. Finally, we willreport summary statistics including but not limited to means, medians, variances, infection rate, cumulative number of cases and/or deaths.
We will write our code in RStudio, save it in GitHub, and make use of version control. We will use Slack as our primary method of communication.
